- Hello, I’m @WinterSun23
- I'm currently doing my Undergrad.
- I'm interested in a variety of things ranging from cellular automata to web development to Raytracers.
- I'm currently trying to learn and develop my fundamentals in the fields that I'm interested in.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I can contribute, so feel free to invite me.
- I'm ready to learn new stuff and I hope to make many contributions.
